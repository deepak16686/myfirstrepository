# File: .env.example
# Purpose: Template for environment variables needed by the source-control docker-compose.
#          Lists all required secrets (Gitea runner token, Nexus credentials, SonarQube token,
#          Splunk HEC token) with empty values for users to fill in.
# When Used: Copied to .env and populated with real values before running the source-control
#            docker-compose. The .env file is gitignored to prevent secret leakage.
# Why Created: Documents all required environment variables in one place so new developers
#              know exactly what secrets they need to configure for the Gitea runner setup.
