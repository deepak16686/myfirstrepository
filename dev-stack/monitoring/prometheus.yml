# File: prometheus.yml
# Purpose: Prometheus monitoring configuration. Defines scrape targets for collecting metrics from
#          all services in the dev-stack: Prometheus itself, Node Exporter (system metrics), and
#          any other exporters configured. Sets 15-second scrape and evaluation intervals.
# When Used: Mounted into the Prometheus container at /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml and read on
#            startup. Prometheus uses this to discover which endpoints to scrape for metrics.
# Why Created: Centralizes observability for the dev-stack platform, enabling Grafana dashboards
#              to visualize system health, resource usage, and service availability across all
#              containers in the stack.
